I am a software engineer by profession and a poet by heart, although I remain unknown. I've been in the software industry for a while and have primarily worked on internal tools for various enterprises. 

This duality of my life allows me to explore creativity in both structured code and free verse. While my technical skills help solve complex problems, my poetry provides an outlet for my emotions and thoughts, weaving together the threads of my experiences.

I have a handful of production-grade experiences with **Golang**, **Android**, **Swift**, **JavaScript** applications, **DevOps** releases, and **Kubernetes**. Through this blend of technical proficiency and artistic expression, I strive to bring a unique perspective to every project I undertake. 

Outside of my 9-5 job, I usually get busy with reading and writing. Lately, I find myself as a couch potato and have been wasting a lot of time on nothing. Recently become sufficiently interested in  **Zig**ðŸ¦Ž  to begin writing a basic microservice framework for my own needs.
